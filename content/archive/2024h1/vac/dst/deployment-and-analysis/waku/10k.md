### Description

Run 10,000 Waku nodes actively passing messages in one network.

Gather bandwidth details, deliverability rate, retrieval times. Measure reliability, improve reliability and document deployment and analysis processes.

Gather QoS details such as latency, dropped packets, etc.

### Justification

### Deliverables
Documentation of both the deployment process and actual deployments.

Useful analytics for the Waku team that can be used to improve the Waku software.

Research articles such as blog posts about the large scale clusters.

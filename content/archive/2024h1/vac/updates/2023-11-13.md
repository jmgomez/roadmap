### vac:p2p:

    - Dive into the Yamux/Relayv2 problem - https://github.com/status-im/nim-libp2p/pull/979
- `nimlibp2p:vac:maintenance`
    - Add Hole Punching to libp2p test-plans https://github.com/status-im/nim-libp2p/issues/966 and https://github.com/libp2p/test-plans/pull/322
    - Yamux doesn't work in a Relayv2 connection https://github.com/status-im/nim-libp2p/pull/
    - Single-board computer (SBC) support https://github.com/status-im/nim-libp2p/issues/978
    - ARM64/aarch64 support https://github.com/status-im/nim-libp2p/issues/980
    - Test Plans repo fork updated and resources to run tests requested https://github.com/status-im/libp2p-test-plans
    - Implementing Nimble lock file functionality https://github.com/status-im/nim-libp2p/issues/975 https://github.com/status-im/nim-libp2p/tree/fix/ci-workflow-stability
    - fix: move workflows for Nim Devel and legacy i386 from "Daily" -> workflows renamed to "Nim Devel" and "Legacy Platforms" https://github.com/status-im/nim-libp2p/pull/968
    - Daily workflow could fail randomly with [OSError] https://github.com/status-im/nim-libp2p/issues/972
- `nimlibp2p:vac:webrtc-transport`
    - Fix read/write on the DTLS
    - Retrieve the remote certificate
    - Start creating a way to log packets behind the DTLS encryption into pcap file in order to make it readable with wireshark
    - WebRTC is done. WebRTC for libp2p isn't:
        - chrome://webrtc-internals/ show no errors, neither wireshark.
        - But libp2p spec requires a weird handshake that I haven't finished yet

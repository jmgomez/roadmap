# Codex Update May 14th - May 20th
> The Codex team wrapped up a successful demo at the Logos off-site and now aims to prepare the demo for the Q2 public testnet release potentially coinciding with EthCC. 
> 
> An internal devnet has been running for the past few weeks and has been used to test the latest version of Codex and can be accessed using the [Codex Testnet Starter](https://github.com/codex-storage/codex-testnet-starter) documentation.

Development is currently broken into three distinct teams: 

1. Client, Testing, and Infrastructure
2. Marketplace 
3. Research

The following are their team updates.

## Client, Testing and Infrastructure
Completed
- Packaged self-contained LevelDB Nim project so no dependencies on system packages lifted from existing wrapper and then wrapped it in a datastore implementation
    - Preliminary tests shows increased performance is as expected
- Resolved issue with dependency bump and broken dependency chain and now stuck with serialization issue - bug was related to resolving to wrong deserializer and work on nim-serde and nim-RPC

Ongoing
- Started work on LevelDB migration; Discord bot, reward system and chain inspection broken
- Resolving failing integration tests re: expiry of the request in storage
- Working on issue related to inability to see amount of tokens sent in block explorer
- Deploying faucet web app for testnet tokens (ETH & TST)
- Working on Codex release workflow
- Trying to use DST's k8s cluster and have not been able to use it yet
- Migrate dist test cluster from Digital Ocean to Hetzner and deploy different mointoring tools (e.g., Victoria Metrics) - parametrics logs replacing elastic search with similar API and CLI scrollingto be added to UI later on

## Marketplace
Completed
- Helped with some work related to LevelDB integration
- Added custom errors PR in nim-ethers that required attention

Ongoing
- Writing documentation around some of the Solidity code ahead of audit
- Coordinating audit with SC team (Vac) and looping in Security; still deciding on 2nd security audit company

## Research
```
2024 R&D Goals
1. Proving system and aggregation improvements (folding or lookups)
2. Aggregator/validator design
3. DHT improvements
4. Tokenomics and incentive design
5. Bandwidth incentives
6. Dynamic data (appendable data)
7. Encryption
```
Completed
- Sync w/ Client team about `circom-compat`
- Studying bulletproofs with the goal to try to use them in proof recursion, on the "wrong" curve - [see writeup here](https://hackmd.io/@bkomuves/BkBm9X0zC)
- Updated thinking about [proof recursion](https://hackmd.io/@bkomuves/rJ-bGisfC)
- Wrote a [high-level overview](https://github.com/codex-storage/codex-storage-proofs-circuits/blob/master/workflow/PROOFS.md) explaining all the moving parts of a ZK proofs (different files and steps and their meaning)

Ongoing
- Proposal for tracking proofs (more precisely, the multiset commitments in there) has a scaling problem, and started thinking about an alternative motivated by Plookup
- Looking more into Winograd-type FFT

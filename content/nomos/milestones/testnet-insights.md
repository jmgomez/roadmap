### Core Tasks

- Testnet Instrumentation. Internal, for debugging pre-releases.
    - Health Monitoring
    - Instrumentation for DS debugging
    - Leader selection and Fork visualization
- Network Explorers. Public access, but a critical tool for debugging.
    - Block and mempool explorers

### Action Plan

This work-stream is purely an engineering effort, but with the caveat that introduces user-facing systems like the Network Explorer. Both internal instrumentation and public-facing functionality should be initiated as soon as possible.

The key in implementing these is to start with a minimal functionality keeping these two primary objectives in mind:

1. **Help us** develop, debug and understand our network
2. **Attract users by exposing visualizations of the blockchain** with cool tools for exploring the chain and the network behavior. This is, in a way, a marketing tool.

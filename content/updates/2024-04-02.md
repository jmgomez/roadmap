### vac:dst:

    - Delayed simulations.
    - Finished plotter module tests ready to review (https://github.com/vacp2p/10ksim/pull/19)
    - Finished data class, related PR already merged (https://github.com/vacp2p/10ksim/pull/16)

    - Investigate attacknet (https://twitter.com/ethPandaOps/status/1769773689979974006)
- `eng-10ktool:vac:bandwidth-test`
    - Many many fixes to get Kubernetes with OpenvSwitch + offloading + VMs working
        - Reinstalled 3 nodes with new Debian + Proxmox flavour
        - Installed Mellanox OFED drivers
        - Experimented with VirtIO network, managed to eventually get SR-IOV and Virtual Functions working
    - Waku - Benchmarked 1-worker (one worker as one eighth of a 64 core node) cluster
        - Indications are we can scale to ~14k nodes if scaling is linear, vs CPU usage observed on 1-worker
        - Had 243 Waku nodes, including publishing, running on the worker or 1/8th node with headroom to spare
        - Network offloading appears to about 2x as efficient CPU wise when running Waku
    - Further fixes for offloading setup once SR-IOV was working
    - Waku - Reinstalled 24 workers, then wiped them all and reinstalled 8 of them :(
    - Diagnosed incredibly complicated packet loss issues (which turned out to be caused by cloned VMs - note to self - clean up /etc/machine-id next time!)
    - Waku - Benchmarked 8-worker cluster (1 physical 64-core), scaled to 1200 nodes, hit major issue with Calico
        - Documented here - https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/issues/8676
    - Added caching to Harbor, further investigated removing Harbor rate limits
    - Discovered that adding multiple jobservice workers to Harbor makes rate limits higher
        - Deployed 6 jobservice workers in Harbor
    - Removed Vaxis and Nia from Kubernetes to help with CPU accounting since they host worker VMs

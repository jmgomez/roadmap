### Description



### Work Breakdown & Deliverables

* Sub Milestone 1 (2025): Deployment and Real-World Application Testing

  **Work Breakdown:** Deploy the privacy-centric zkVM in a controlled environment and test its real-world applicability and performance, focusing on privacy-preserving computations.
  
  **Deliverables:** An outline for deploying the zkVM in a test env, including infrastructure and security considerations, along with results of testings focusing on ptivacy preservation.
  

* Sub Milestone 2 (2025): Community Engagement and Open-Source Contributions

  **Work Breakdown:** Engage with the cryptographic and privacy communities and teams within the organization to gather feedback, share insights, and contribute to the open-source ecosystem, fostering wider adoption and collaboration.
  
  **Deliverables:** Release of the developed cryptographic libraries and zkVM source code to the open-source community, accompanied by comprehensive documentation and guides for implementation and use.


**Impact:** This plan underscores the goal for delivering a zkVM with strong focus on privacy enhancements. By identifying and integrating advanced cryptographic primitives, and considering the deployement within environments like Nexus VM or similar VMs, this milestone aims to make significant contributions to the field of privacy-preserving computation. Sub milestones may slightly change and some of them might be accomplished faster than others especially that during the previous period, we have focused on existing zkVMs and extensively studied the integration of cryptographic primitives to enhance pivacy.

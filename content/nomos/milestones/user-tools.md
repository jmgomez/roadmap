### Core Tasks

- Wallet
    - Major browser support
    - Basic functionality: payments, inscriptions, tokens
- Ultra-easy to run validator software
    - Must have GUI and background runner (similar to Dropbox tool)
    - One-click installation for Windows/OSX/Linux

### Action Plan

The priority should be to implement the wallet, since we can have initially a node that is not easy to run. Making it easy is something that can be achieved once we have a functioning system. The wallet is however necessary for any usable Testnet that we want to make public.

The main problem is that the wallet is highly dependent on the Coordination Layer, so further efforts in this area are blocked until that is solved (at least past Phase 1).

# Codex Update June 4th - June 10th
> The Codex team wrapped up a successful demo at the Logos off-site and now aims to prepare the demo for the Q2 public testnet release potentially coinciding with EthCC. 
> 
> An internal devnet has been running for the past few weeks and has been used to test the latest version of Codex and can be accessed using the [Codex Testnet Starter](https://github.com/codex-storage/codex-testnet-starter) documentation.

Development is currently broken into three distinct teams: 

1. Client, Testing, and Infrastructure
2. Marketplace 
3. Research

The following are their team updates.

## Client, Testing and Infrastructure
Completed
- Setup similar VPN from home to cloud VPN for router OS similar to MikroTik router and APs; purchased hardware to test - ordered physical SIM adapter for router

Ongoing
- Workshop preparation
- Ongoing scalability work; intially had to fix the Docker build and got updated build with LevelDB, odd stuff happening in cluster but 4.5GiB exchange for upload/download succeeded
- NAT Planning and roll out

## Marketplace
Completed
- TBD

Ongoing
- Workshop preparation
- Certora setup & integration
  - WIP in the Certora's Application Properties work
- Persistent Availabilities
- Slot Reservations

## Research
```
2024 R&D Goals
1. Proving system and aggregation improvements (folding or lookups)
2. Aggregator/validator design
3. DHT improvements
4. Tokenomics and incentive design
5. Bandwidth incentives
6. Dynamic data (appendable data)
7. Encryption
```
Completed
- Ongoing work on [details of the dynamic data proposal](https://hackmd.io/M6uwhb0eQh2bIh5_O6AX7Q) (the proof parts)
- Helped Nomos with a small FFT issue

Ongoing
- Looking at [new research](https://zkmesh.substack.com/p/zkmesh-may-2024-recap)
- Working on Winograd-type NTT 
- Working on proof recursion
- Looking into more FFT/NTT algorithms (ECFFT, prime order FFT, etc; we need non-power-of-two sizes for foreign field arithmetic)
- [Reliability and Proof Frequency (WIP)](https://colab.research.google.com/gist/cskiraly/e6c87427166323af02a0b4d4442fc61f/codex-reliability-and-proof-frequency.ipynb)

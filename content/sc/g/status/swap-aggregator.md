title: "Status Swap Aggregator"
---
## `vac:sc::status:swap-aggregator`


- status: 0%
- CC: TBD

### Description

The exact details of this milestone are yet to be discussed. However, the general idea is to research if we could build a swap aggregator similar to MetaMask Swap and Rainbow Swap for Status.

Research has to be done in what existing system exist, how they work and how they capture revenue. Ideally we find a model that works for Status as well.

### Justification

Both, MetaMask and Rainbow Wallet are making most of their revenue with their Swap protocols. With enough users, a small percentage of every trade could accumulate a significant amount of reoccuring revenue.

### Deliverables

TBD

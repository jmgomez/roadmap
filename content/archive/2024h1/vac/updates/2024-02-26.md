    - It was due to a couple of error / bug:
      - On nwaku a ping connection opened wasn't closed
      - On yamux the timeout wasn't implemented
    - The implementation + testing of the implementation showed a sneaky bug (fixed)

### vac:dst:
- `eng-10ktool:vac:bandwidth-test`
    - Set up cluster without K3s (with Wings's help) and test P2P PR 1045
    - Keep working on Thanos metrics scrapping: PR: https://github.com/vacp2p/10ksim/pull/3
    - Gathered detailed metrics for paper on Waku scaling
    - Ran 4 simulations
    - Various metrics tuning on Emerald k8s
    - Completely rebuilt the Kubernetes cluster (and about 80% of the lab)
        - New cluster is called Opal, the sequel to Emerald
        - Uses Cilium (on top of the Multus metaplugin) for much higher network performance
        - Entirely bare metal, currently 3 nodes (pending 4th node returning, happening by EOW)
        - Uses the new VLAN structure, clean credentials
    - Fixed an issue with Metrics still using Longhorn
    - Figured out how to use the backup and restore tool Velero
    - Added KubeVirt for virtual machine hosting and management inside Kubernetes
        - Will make it easier for us to provision machines for other teams
        - Backed by Rook-Ceph
    - Many tweaks to Kubernetes, Cilium, metrics, and more - see https://www.notion.so/Opal-Kubernetes-Cluster-Lab-Rebuild-4c8472546b0d47f5b05debacf9c7ac29
    - Fixed multiple major networking issues with the lab (again)
    - Added the ability to multi-home k8s pods through Multus (ie: attach them to multiple networks)
    - Debugged and fixed a huge issue with TLS certificate issuance through Let's Encrypt - turned out to be Cloudflare's fault (Universal SSL basically broke my LE DNS-01 challenges, hard)
    - Scaled up Redis to 18 nodes (6 master, 12 replicas) for additional safety under heavy load

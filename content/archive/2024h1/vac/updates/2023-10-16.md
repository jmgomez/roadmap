  - Improvements:
    - Speed up execution from 12m to 3.5m for 250 tests through [parallelization](https://github.com/waku-org/js-waku/pull/1655)(Significant refactoring needed to achieve this)
    - Follow up [fix](https://github.com/waku-org/js-waku/pull/1662) to only allow paralellization in CI env

  - Heavily investigate issues shown on tests
    - Max 1MB message size, no graceful handle.
    - After stopping and restarting a relay node, can't reconnect it with `connectRelay`.
    - Can't stop a relay node and send a message: Inconsistent with filter push behaviour.
    - Publishing multiple messages in a row triggers the same SEGFAULT as when refreshing a subscription.
- `software-testing:waku:test-automation-go-waku`
  - Wrote five tests - were added to the branch https://github.com/waku-org/go-waku/tree/chore(filterV2)-test-updates
  - Reported issue "Messages won't get through with multiple pubsub topics" https://github.com/waku-org/go-waku/issues/804
  - Tracking coverage as notes so far -> will change to tabular form. Notion has API, we could possibly update docs during test execution? https://www.notion.so/Filter-Test-Coverage-42fc15b503ec4621980a7757d85089db?pvs=4

### vac:dr:
- `gsub-scaling:vac:gossipsub-simulation`
  - Looked in to previous [staggered message sending approach](https://github.com/vacp2p/nim-libp2p/commit/9b11fa733220910359a38876f8afb9d7ff029641). Require manualy resetting nim/nimble to match the branch dates. The performance evaluation results are available [here](https://www.notion.so/Performance-Evaluation-of-Old-Staggered-Sending-Approach-b458ebafbd744182846c3ad0f7ea3d08)  
  - As no gains are seen, looking for other possible improvements (delayed elimination of peers from queues on receiving idontwants), adapting stagger delays to peer speeds/scores. still a WIP
- `vac:admin`
    - Work on blog drafts for Verkle Trees, KZG, and BloomFilters.
- `zk:codex:zk-consulting`
    - Provided feedback on bkomuves' [notes](https://hackmd.io/@bkomuves/SyPHG0PfR) on Codex tracking proofs.
    - Began report on Groth16 as final compression layer, and current state of pairing-based recursion proof systems.
- `vac:dr:anon:vac:gossipsub-anonymity`
    - Continued working on [Anonymity Layer](https://www.notion.so/Anonymity-Layer-Wip-cbcbcd6067b347bb812041bce9c110ce) - WiP.
    - Read Tor Push and Dandelion++ solutions
        - Still can't figure out the actual advantage of using onion encryption.
        - In the pub-sub model, adding delays and/or relaying through an anonymity/mix overlay network should offer the desired level of protection.
        - However, such an overlay network will be similar to Dandellion++ only.
        - Still trying to figure out how to overcome the shortcomings in Dandellion++.

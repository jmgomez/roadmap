# Codex Update May 7th - May 13th
> The Codex team wrapped up a successful demo at the Logos off-site and now aims to prepare the demo for the Q2 public testnet release potentially coinciding with EthCC. 
> 
> An internal devnet has been running for the past few weeks and has been used to test the latest version of Codex and can be accessed using the [Codex Testnet Starter](https://github.com/codex-storage/codex-testnet-starter) documentation.

Development is currently broken into three distinct teams: 

1. Client, Testing, and Infrastructure
2. Marketplace 
3. Research

The following are their team updates.

## Client, Testing and Infrastructure
Completed
- Organized new Kanban board to sort through new and existing Epics and Issues associated with ongoing work to test & fix bugs in the core client towards stability - two large items of focus for the coming two months is:
    - EthCC Workshop Client work
    - First release of Codex for the testnets
- Fixed upload/addition of blocks but did not fix it in the advertising loop yet
- Finished evaluation of LevelDB vs SQLite

Ongoing
- Splitting two big PRs into a series of smaller ones
  - [Expiry per dataset](https://github.com/codex-storage/nim-codex/pull/678)
  - [Safe block deletion (with ref count)](https://github.com/codex-storage/nim-codex/pull/631)

## Marketplace
Completed
- New proposal for slot reservations and capturing the original bloem method idea; developed simplified version of slot reservations opting to allow for emergent behaviors before adding to complexity
- Completed PR Reviews and merged:
  - [Feat: expiry specified with number of seconds](https://github.com/codex-storage/nim-codex/pull/793)
  - [Feat: expiry specified as duration](https://github.com/codex-storage/codex-contracts-eth/pull/99)

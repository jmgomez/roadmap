### vac:tke:
- `nomos:economic-analysis`
  - tested a new data layout for the PoS-GPU code (to allow a large number of blocks per epoch);
  - implemented a CPU-only code that outperformed the GPU (thanks to a trick given by David and Alexander);
  - ran simulations about wealth concentration and observed leader election on Cryptarchia.
- `codex:economic-analysis`
  - reviewed comparables tokenomics (Filecoin);
  - reviewed the state of CDX token, inc. insurance model.
- `waku:economic-analysis`
  - reviewed Martin's work on RLN pricing
  - 2x Waku RLN calls (Tokenomics, L2 for RLN) and follow-ups
- `status:SNT-staking`
  - continuing work on Status DeFi analysis
  - continuing work on Status staking contract

### vac:dst:
- `eng-10ktool:vac:bandwidth-test`
    - Talk again with p2p team about versioning
    - Done simulations for Yamux
    - Re-do simulations without using Wireguard. Packet loss is the same if not even higher (?)
    - Plan how to structure the 10k tool framework
    - Optimized publisher and added a debug flag to get DNS resolve times. 
    - Briefly ran a full 10K scale simulation, as well as other simulations at 7.5K, 8K, 5K and 0.1K
    - Scaled metrics up by sharding it then adding Thanos (via `bitnami` charts) Query and Thanos Query Frontend to aggregate the metrics
    - Dealing with various scaling issues as they come up
    - Added latency delay to pods, allowing us to do arbitrary amounts of latency in Waku nodes

# Codex Update May 28th - June 3rd
> The Codex team wrapped up a successful demo at the Logos off-site and now aims to prepare the demo for the Q2 public testnet release potentially coinciding with EthCC. 
> 
> An internal devnet has been running for the past few weeks and has been used to test the latest version of Codex and can be accessed using the [Codex Testnet Starter](https://github.com/codex-storage/codex-testnet-starter) documentation.

Development is currently broken into three distinct teams: 

1. Client, Testing, and Infrastructure

### vac:sc::

### vac:nim:
- `tooling:vac:compiler`
  - Fix an issue in nimsuggest where unknown files werent being handled: https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/pull/23696
  - Backports: https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/pull/23702 and https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/pull/23701
  - Fix: "#23695: On Linux, "nimsuggest" crashes if Nim is installed in /usr/bin and the library in /usr/lib/nim" https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/pull/23697
- `tooling:vac:lsp`
    - Implements the `extension/status` endpoint (https://github.com/nim-lang/langserver/commit/3879966eed20f04ce4254b67c5c6496c06358b79)
		It's useful for asserting in tests in a reliable way as it exposes the langserver and nimsuggest instances current status (i.e. main file, known files, etc.) It can also be useful to create a specific window in extension to quickly inspect the current status for a given project
- `tooling:vac:editor`
  - Implements Show NimLangServer Status command. (https://github.com/nim-lang/vscode-nim/pull/67)
	  Right now is just outputing into the output window. In the near future we are going to build a separate window to inspect it.

**This milestone is updated on weekly basis. For a more up-to-date status head over to the [milestone on GitHub](https://github.com/status-im/communities-contracts/milestone/2).

### Description

This milestone focuses on the airdrop functionality of community vaults.
The general idea is that community owners and token masters can airdrop tokens that live in the community vault to other accounts and community members.

Part of this milestone is to figure out which airdrop strategy makes most sense and then implementing it.

### Justification


### Deliverables

* Airdrop functionality in existing vault contracts
* Documentation
* Tests
* Formal verification

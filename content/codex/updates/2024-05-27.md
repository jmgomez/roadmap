# Codex Update May 21th - May 27th
> The Codex team wrapped up a successful demo at the Logos off-site and now aims to prepare the demo for the Q2 public testnet release potentially coinciding with EthCC. 
> 
> An internal devnet has been running for the past few weeks and has been used to test the latest version of Codex and can be accessed using the [Codex Testnet Starter](https://github.com/codex-storage/codex-testnet-starter) documentation.

Development is currently broken into three distinct teams: 

1. Client, Testing, and Infrastructure
2. Marketplace 
3. Research

The following are their team updates.

## Client, Testing and Infrastructure
Completed
- N/A

Ongoing
- Continued work on LevelDB migration; [failing unit test uncovered bug](https://github.com/codex-storage/nim-codex/pull/816) on race condition in one of the state machines in the Marketplace module and switch to LevelDB reveleaed it and changing timing of DB reproduced it; reproduced it in SQLite by putting a sleep statement and nothing wrong in LevelDB
    - Marketplace picked this bug up
- Docker build problems; Rust build failed and Circom devices no longer building - rolled back Codex to previous Docker image and it doesn't build anymore so not something changed on our end
- Working on debugging Rust FFI threading

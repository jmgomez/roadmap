# Codex Update June 18th - June 24th
> The Codex team wrapped up a successful demo at the Logos off-site and now aims to prepare the demo for the Q2 public testnet release potentially coinciding with EthCC. 
> 
> An internal devnet has been running for the past few weeks and has been used to test the latest version of Codex and can be accessed using the [Codex Testnet Starter](https://github.com/codex-storage/codex-testnet-starter) documentation.

Development is currently broken into three distinct teams: 

1. Client, Testing, and Infrastructure
2. Marketplace 
3. Research

The following are their team updates.

## Client, Testing and Infrastructure
Completed
- Merged safe block deletion PR

Ongoing
- Workshop preparations
  - Slides presentation and complete demo run-through
- Manifest initialization bug
- Crash fixing; second release failing because of CPU load - possible prover blocking I/O and need better threading (to use async profiler to resolve this)
- Work on scheduler
- Working on bug fix for EC issues
  - Problem with verifiable manifest (was not enabled for Athens demo) & tree roots issue
  - Crashes resulting in SIGSEGV error

## Marketplace
Completed
- Hired full-stack dev to work on Codex App and some Client/Marketplace tasks

Ongoing
- Workshop preparations
  - Frontend session cookies issue - CORS requests problems; sticky sessions are problem for replicated services because reqeusts can be sent to different sessions, problem is how to persist RPC session w/ 3 RPC nodes and if you want to send all requests to same RPC node is problematic
- WIP in the Certora's Application Properties work

## Research
```
2024 R&D Goals
1. Proving system and aggregation improvements (folding or lookups)
2. Aggregator/validator design
3. DHT improvements

```

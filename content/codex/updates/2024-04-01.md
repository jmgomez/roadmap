# Codex Update Mar 26th - Apr 1st

> The Codex team continues to make progress with various initiatives to wrap up the demo for the Q1/Q2 public testnet release. An internal testnet has been running for the past few weeks and has been used to test the latest version of Codex and can be accessed using the [Codex Testnet Starter](https://github.com/codex-storage/codex-testnet-starter) documentation.
> 
> Ongoing and new lines of research and development will soon begin in preparation for the next version of Codex that will be used for the mainnet release.. Here are the updates from different team members and their ongoing work.
Development is currently broken into three distinct teams: 

1. Client, Testing, and Infrastructure
2. Marketplace 
3. Research

The different teams have actively moving on various fronts. The following are their team updates to various ongoing Epics.

- Disable stacktrace on SAT solver to avoid stackoverflows in debug builds https://github.com/nim-lang/sat/pull/5#event-12262613353
- Wrote up draft for Nimble Caching RFC https://hackmd.io/@elcritch/rJ4VrExJR

## Marketplace
Completed
- Revisit design of https://github.com/codex-storage/nim-codex/issues/467
- Review https://github.com/codex-storage/nim-codex/pull/692
- Review https://github.com/codex-storage/nim-codex/pull/678, many reviews and ongoing discussion
- Review https://github.com/codex-storage/nim-codex/pull/730
- Chore to remove no longer used compilation flag: https://github.com/codex-storage/nim-codex/pull/741
- Tried to understand why an integration was indeterminately failing in CI and locally, thought was very difficult to reproduce
- Merged https://github.com/codex-storage/nim-codex/pull/704, which had the integration test failure. Re-running the failed test in CI was enough to get it to merge, but indicates there is an issue with this test
- Rebased and merged MarketError PR: https://github.com/codex-storage/nim-codex/pull/670
- Updated pausing slot queue design PR: https://github.com/codex-storage/codex-research/pull/188/
-  Re-reviewed [feat[marketplace]: add slot queue pausing PR #752](https://github.com/codex-storage/nim-codex/pull/752) in Codex and started review of [Expiry per dataset PR #678](https://github.com/codex-storage/nim-codex/pull/678/)
-  Added protection branch rule for `nim-ethers` in Codex
-  Reviewed PRs [#757](https://github.com/codex-storage/nim-codex/pull/757), [#752](https://github.com/codex-storage/nim-codex/pull/752), [#760](https://github.com/codex-storage/nim-codex/pull/760), [#69](https://github.com/codex-storage/nim-ethers/pull/69/), and [#70](https://github.com/codex-storage/nim-ethers/pull/70) in Codex
-  Reviewed comments for the Availability Patch PR and [Pausing Queue PR](https://github.com/codex-storage/nim-codex/pull/752/files) in Codex

Ongoing
- Discussed with team plans to improve integration tests: what they should cover, parallelism, and whether or not some could be replaced with unit tests. Also discussed some open issues and PR comments.
- Continued work on implementation of slot queue pausing. Most implementation in, need to add tests: https://github.com/codex-storage/nim-codex/tree/feat/marketplace/slot-queue-improvements
- Worked on updating a macro for Optionalize to add the serialize pragma annotation on the type. Tried to get the macro to read existing serialize annotations on the type and fields first but was taking too long, so moved on
-  Discussions about release branches, proof circuit assets, and versioning
-  Discussed `Optionalize()` macro and `serialize` pragma
-  Discussed the parallelism of integration tests
- Progress on Persistent Availabilities implementation

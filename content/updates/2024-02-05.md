## Vac 2024/02/05

### vac:p2p:
- `nimlibp2p:vac:webrtc-transport`
    - Fix a bug in `Datachannel.read` (reading the last message received instead of the first one)
    - Fix a bug due to an Sctp delay (set it to 0ms was the solution)
    - Find a bug in the conception of WebRTCStream. ReadOnce should be Length-prefixed.
        - try to fix it by re-writing ReadOnce, but due to the nature of this proc (inheritance issue) it doesn't work
        - write a RawWebRTCStream to make the length readable without issue
    - Fix a bug with the endianness of the datachannel protocol id
    - E2E Done! 
- `nimlibp2p:vac:gossipsub-stagger-send`
    - feat: make relayed messages non priority (don't use an explicit queue for priority msgs) - https://github.com/status-im/nim-libp2p/pull/1015
    - feat: drop msgs to be relayed waiting for too long in the queue - https://github.com/status-im/nim-libp2p/pull/1015
- `nimlibp2p:vac:maintenance`
    - Investigate dependencies issues
        - Found possible problem/s
            - Lack of versioning
            - No major version clamping
            - Using #head
        - Temporary workaround: Clamp/Pin (to git hash) libp2p dependencies' versions
            - [PR](https://github.com/status-im/nim-libp2p/pull/1020)
    - Improve documentation [In Progress]
        - Building go-libp2p-daemon
        - Getting Started
        - [PR](https://github.com/status-im/nim-libp2p/pull/1021)
    - Merge timeout increase
    - Improved `checkExpiring`
        - Now it'll outpout an error message when it fails due to timeout
            - Not the most visible message

### vac:tke:

  - Matty Handoff document finished and share with team on Wed (@Matty)
  - Team Lead Evaluation Criteria finished and share with team on Wed (@Matty)
  - Strengths and development areas for Frederico and Martin, shared with Corey, Daniel, and Jarrad (@Matty)
- `codex:economic-analysis`
  - finalize all Codex notion including Dragan's comments to litepaper (@Matty)
  - Wednesday call with Codex team get in sync on next steps
- `status:SNT-staking`
  - staking contract implementation becoming a priority, refresh latest progress with SC team (@Martin)

### vac:dst:
- `eng-10ktool:vac:bandwidth-test`
    - Try to get a stable nim-libp2p version for simulations. Investigated with Alex about building issues with nimble.
    - Analized libp2p metrics, everything normal so far
    - call with p2p team
    - Scale testing for 10K project
        - setup go-waku experiment at scale
        - Successfully simulated a 2,150 node simulation and gathered some basic metrics
        - Modified Kubernetes to allow for more pods to allow for (in theory) scaling to 10k+
        - Failed simulations at 10000 and 5000 nodes - current limits seem to be around ~4800 or so
        - Prometheus is a definite bottleneck - need to switch to a scaled/sharded Prometheus/***Thanos*** setup
        - Attempting one last simulation over the weekend at 4200 nodes
    - Diagnosing 10K project bottlenecks
        - Identified a major potential bottleneck in the form of control plane traffic going over Wireguard / large packet load over WG causing swarm collapse
        - will test the new theory later by re-deploying on Vac Kubernetes with a local control plane + local traffic (while still complying with infra team requirements)

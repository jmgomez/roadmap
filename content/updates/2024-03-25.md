### vac:dst:
- `eng-10ktool:vac:bandwidth-test`
    - Finish plotter module tests and prepare PR (ongoing)
    - Thanos PR merged (https://github.com/vacp2p/10ksim/pull/15)
    - Create class to manage data (https://github.com/vacp2p/10ksim/pull/16).
    - hardware offloaded for Waku testing
        - Built 24 new Kubernetes workers, configured them with static IPs and all tuning
        - Got new CX6 cards updated, configured, installed and working
        - Achieved hardware offloading; but:
        - Running a Waku workload, two interesting things happened
            - When we started the publisher, the load increased until the physical nodes become so unusably slow that they needed IPMI intervention to come back to life
            - Checking the offloadeded flows during the test (prior to publishing) showed no offloaded routes or flows.
        - We need to figure out how to get our workload offloaded correctly.

### vac:dr:
- `valpriv:vac:val-priv-net`
  - Feedback waiting competing/ proposal (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UNOJfA-4f6tco3ozuiyLIbfDkf70Mh_6OqEfB8vmblE/edit?usp=sharing)
- `valpriv:vac:tor-push-poc`
  - could not launch holesky validators yet this week.
- `valpriv:vac:tor-push-paper`
  - Finished changes as per feedback; next feedback round
- `gsub-scaling:vac:gossipsub-simulation`
  - Played with IDontWant messags with different arrangements. Mainly investigated reduced message sending with/without hello messages.
    Reduced sending shows nearly 5-10% latency and 20-25% bandwidth reduction when message sizes reach beyond 600 KB.
    The findings are available as [notion page](https://www.notion.so/Limited-Forwarding-Can-Reduce-Latency-for-Large-Messages-a1d7797313694f0c856b0330bec77ae0#70563bd453944337b92e87674d5e2055)  
	- Interestingly {Reduced sending + IDontWant} without IHAVE messages shows similar performance to {Reduced sending + IDontWant + IHAVE}
